# P5_Juneja_Ishan_PersonalJavaFXGame
This is Ishan Juneja's version of Breakout Room 13 project

Commit 1: 5/12/21 Today, I focused on fixing underlying issues in the ball movement. One current problem is how the ball doesn't bounce off at certain speeds when the paddle moves. The next part I worked on was fully implementing the scores. Then I got a good start on the additions to the brick class to give the brick more health. Lastly, I started with the Power Up class and will focus on that in the coming days

Commit 2: 5/13/21 Today I continued to target the ball movement and tweaked it to not get stuck in positions after hitting the paddle but however sometimes when using the paddle to hit the ball, the ball hits the ground and makes the user lose points. The next part I focused on was the power up, I edited the power up class to add a new Class Temporary Ball I made for the power up to act like a ball but disappear after hitting the bottom of the screen and not the paddle. The place where I left off was trying to use the timer for future power ups.
