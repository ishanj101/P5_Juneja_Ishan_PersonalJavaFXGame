# P5_Juneja_Ishan_PersonalJavaFXGame
This is Ishan Juneja's version of Breakout Room 13 project

Commit 1: 5/12/21 Today, I focused on fixing underlying issues in the ball movement. One current problem is how the ball doesn't bounce off at certain speeds when the paddle moves. The next part I worked on was fully implementing the scores. Then I got a good start on the additions to the brick class to give the brick more health. Lastly, I started with the Power Up class and will focus on that in the coming days
